# Media storage

## Development

Django `FileSystemStorage` under `backend/media/` (`MEDIA_ROOT`).  
Served when `DEBUG=true` via Django static media URLs (`/media/...`).

Frontend resolves relative media paths using the API origin (`frontend/src/lib/media.ts`) — no hardcoded production localhost.

## Production

Platforms with **ephemeral filesystems** (many container hosts) will **lose uploads** on restart if media is only local.

Choose one:

1. **Persistent volume** mounted at `MEDIA_ROOT` (acceptable short/medium term)
2. **Future S3-compatible storage** (django-storages or equivalent) — not integrated in this phase

WhiteNoise serves **Django static** files (`collectstatic`), not user media. Keep that boundary clear.

Next.js hosts its own `.next` static assets separately.

## Image URLs

- Prefer absolute URLs returned by the API, or paths starting with `/media/` resolved against the API host.
- Configure `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` so `next.config.ts` remotePatterns allow `/media/**` from that host.

## Orphans

Report unreferenced local files:

```bash
python manage.py report_orphan_media
# optional destructive: python manage.py report_orphan_media --delete
```

Dry-run is the default behavior without `--delete`.
